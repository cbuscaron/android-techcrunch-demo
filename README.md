# Android Vinli TechCrunch Demo

This is a simple demo application demonstrating the usage of the Vinli Bluetooth SDK for communicating with a nearby Vinli device over BLE. It makes heavy use of RxJava, but deep knowledge the mechanics of rx should not be required. Refer to [TechCrunchDemoActivity.java](app/src/main/java/li/vin/techcrunchdemo/TechCrunchDemoActivity.java) for comments documenting usage.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The My Vinli standalone app must be installed for this demo to function properly. Please contact Greg Aker (greg@vin.li) for access.
