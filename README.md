# Android Vinli TechCrunch Demo

This is a simple demo application demonstrating the usage of the Vinli Bluetooth SDK for communicating with a nearby Vinli device over BLE. It makes heavy use of RxJava, but deep knowledge the mechanics of rx should not be required. Refer to the demo app's Activity for comments documenting usage.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The My Vinli standalone app must be installed for this demo to function properly. Please contact Grek Aker (greg@vinli) for access.
